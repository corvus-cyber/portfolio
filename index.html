                <!--BIO-->
                <p>Born and raised in the great Pacific Northwest, the gloomy weather encouraged me from a young age to embrace reading. 
                Until I was eighteen most of my time was spent with my nose in a book, completely spellbound by characters like Harry Potter, Kaladin, Aragorn and Percy Jackson.  
                I attended a high school where our team name were the “Papermakers” and our mascot was a robot known as the Mean Machine; to this day I don’t really know what a “Mean Machine” actually is. 
                I really never cared enough to find out; I was more interested in exploring the library then attending sporting events. At eighteen I left the United States and served an LDS mission in Novosibirsk Russia, 
                a place of environmental extremes and populated by a people who stole my heart and who taught me about how diverse and beautiful the world truly is.
                </p>
                <p>Following my mission I graduated from Brigham Young University in the Spring of 2019 with a degree in International Relations and Russian. 
                During my time in university I worked abroad as a strategic analyst for the parliament of Latvia, traveling all over the Baltics, 
                France, Germany, Italy and Croatia. However, towards the close of my education I fell in love and got married; 
                and I knew that it was important for my new family that we find a place here in Utah rather than follow my previous ambition of becoming a diplomat. 
                </p>
                <p>After graduating I began work as a financial analyst at a local tech investment firm based out of Lehi, 
                where I began to learn about the rapidly growing opportunities here in the valley.
                Having enjoyed the data-analysis background that I acquired during my major, I have decided to pursue web-development as I will be able to take my love for creative problem solving and apply it within a growing industry. 
                </p>

                <h4>Financial Analyst</h4>

                <p>
                    Predicted profitability of Utah companies who applied to Frazier Group for investment. 
                    First, I led research into their inner workings, evaluating sales pipeline, management, revenue and economic growth trends. 
                    I then ran various regressions, prepared visuals of the data and and presented my findings to the CEO of the company. 
                    I also prepared Quarterly statements for investors in the Lumen fund (Frazier Group’s sister Fund) on the past and predicted profits. 
                    I was also key in managing relations with other investors in Utah by keeping ties relevant. This meant attending shareholder meetings, analyzing current financial situations in the market as a whole and determining whether follow-up investment would be prudent.

                Lead analyst on political effects portfolios for the European Commission for Foreign Affairs in the Latvian Parliament. 
                I first performed technical research, then input variables into regressions to determine the various effects these movements could have on the Latvian state. 
                Projects included: Analysis of Social Media Trends in US 2016 Election, effectiveness of East Stratcom, 
                fallout effects of Brexit (concerning the three outlying regions) and an analysis of energy production in the US.
